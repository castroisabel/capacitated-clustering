# capacitated-clustering

The Capacitated Clustering Problem (CCP) consists of forming a specified number of clusters or groups from a set of elements in such a way that the sum of the weights of the elements in each cluster is within some capacity limits, and the sum of the benefits between the pairs of elements in the same cluster is maximized. This problem arises in the context of facility planners at mail processing and distribution.
